= Introduction =

You must give focus to the tracking layer in order to use the *keyboard* shorcuts.
This can be done automatically on Windows boxes, but unfortunately it does not work on Linux. So, we all must be on an equal footing ;)

= Keyboard shorcuts =

By now there are defined two useful keys:

 * SPACE: pauses the visualization.
 * ESC: destroys the realtime replaying and displays the data as a static picture.

= Control Panel =

If you've tried [http://smt.speedzinemedia.com/smt/test the live demos], at this point you should know that:

 * CTRL + Click on the tracking layer (Mac users should do CMD + Click) toggles the control panel.

The rest is very intuitive IMHO.
