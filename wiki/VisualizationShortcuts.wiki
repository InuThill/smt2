#summary Visualization and Shortcuts
#labels Phase-Design


= Introduction =

You must give focus to the tracking layer in order to use the *keyboard* shortcuts.
This can be done automatically on Windows boxes, but unfortunately it does not work on Linux. So, we all must be on an equal footing ;)

On the JavaScript visualization tool this first-click-to-interact is not required. However, the JavaScript version is deprecated and may not be developed further in a future.


= Keyboard shortcuts =

By now there are defined two useful keys:

 * SPACE: pauses/plays the visualization.
 * ESC: destroys the realtime replaying and displays the data as a static picture.

= Control Panel =

If you've tried [http://smt.speedzinemedia.com/smt/test the live demos], at this point you should know that:

 * CTRL + Click on the tracking layer (Mac users should do CMD + Click) toggles the control panel implemented.

The rest is very intuitive IMHO.
Note that on the JavaScript-only version there is no Control Panel.


= Visualization Layers =

|| *layer name* || *meaning* ||
|| background overlay || layer for separating page and tracking ||
|| interacted areas || areas where the mouse passed ||
|| mouse path || the path followed by the mouse ||
|| coordinates || tracked registration points ||
|| hesitations || mouse stop zones (dwell times) ||
|| drag&drop/selections || clicks without releasing the button ||
|| clicks || mouse clicks ||
|| direction & distances || computed mouse distances between registration points ||
|| active areas || custering of mouse coordinates ||
|| path centroid || geometric center of mouse coordinates ||
|| mouse pointers || entry, exit, wait and normal mouse cursors ||
