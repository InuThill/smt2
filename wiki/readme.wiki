#summary This an introductory page for describing the new smt2 version
#labels Featured

= Requirements =

Your Web server needs a *MySQL 5* database and *PHP 5* installed with the libraries *cURL* and *json*. These settings are very common on most Web servers. If you don't know if your server has these requirements, you will be adviced when installing the system.


= Download =

Downloads are available in a ZIP file either from the [http://smt.speedzinemedia.com/smt/downloads.php (smt) website] or the [http://code.google.com/p/smt2/downloads/list Project Downloads page].

You may grab two zipped files:
 # The production version, ready for using on your webserver (~300 Kb).
 # The sources and API documentation (~400 Kb).

You can also download all the project (production, sources, documentation, etc.) from the [http://code.google.com/p/smt2/downloads/list Google code SVN] (RECOMMENDED OPTION).

= Installing =

The installation process is very similar to the well-known WordPress Content Management System (CMS), so the learning curve is supposed to be very soft.

It is recommended to put the system in a directory named `/smt2` on your localhost or production server, although any other directory name is ok.

== Steps ==

First of all, you must configure the basic stuff by editing the file `config.php`. Then, just upload the `smt2` folder to your Web server.

Assuming that you've uploaded the files to a server called `mysite.com`:

 # Open your Web browser and navigate to the URL `http://mysite.com/smt2/admin/sys/install.php`.
 # Enter your email and click the `Install` button. That email will be used to send you the root password.
 # Once the installation process finishes, copy the generated password and log in (your username is *root*) to the CMS. You can change that password on the _users_ section.

=== Upgrading ===

If you already have a previous 2.x version installed, you can overwrite such installation with the new files and then update your database info by navigating to the URL `http://mysite.com/smt2/admin/sys/upgrade.php`.


= Uninstalling =

Just go to the URL `http://mysite.com/smt2/admin/sys/uninstall.php` and follow the instructions.


= Including the record script on your page(s) =

You must add the following 2 lines either to the HEAD or the BODY sections of each document that you wish to track:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-aux.min.js"></script>  
<script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-record.min.js"></script>
}}}
Note that order is mandatory: aux functions first.


= Customizing the recording options =

== version 2.0.2 ==

These are the *default* (smt)^2^ recording options that you can change:
{{{
// Tracking frequency, in frames per second.      
fps: 24, 	
// Tracking timeout, in seconds.
recTime: 120, 
// Interval to send data, in seconds
postInterval: 2,
// URL to local smt2 website, i.e., the site URL to track (with the smt*.js files). The record script will try to find it automatically.
trackingServer: "/smt2/", 
// URL to remote smt2 server, i.e., the site URL where the logs will be stored, and (of course) the CMS is installed.
storageServer: "",
// You may choose to advice users (or not) that their mouse activity is going to be logged. 
warn: false, 
// Text to display when advising users (if warn is set to true).
warnText: "We'd like to track your mouse activity\nin order to improve this website's usability.\nDo you agree?", 
// Cookies lifetime (in days) to reset both first time users and agreed-to-track visitors
cookieDays: 365,
// Random user selection. Setting it to false (or 0) means that all the population will be tracked.      
disabled: 0 //Math.round(Math.random()) // <-- random sampling is recommended!
}}}

To override these defaults you do not need to edit manually the record script, just keep reading these instructions. 

=== Important new feature: cross-domain POSTs ===
In version 2.0.2 two variables were introduced to customize the recording script: `trackingServer` and `storageServer`. 
In this way one can record mouse activity in domain A, and post data to a domain B. 
To achieving that goal, just type in `storageServer` the URL of the server where both the CMS and the database are installed (following the previous naming convention, it would be server B), and put the `core` dir in the domain that you wish to track (server A). 
So, one can have only one domain (server B) for storing and managing logs/users/etc., and multiple domains to be tracked.

Please notice that in previous 2.x versions neither `trackingServer` nor `storageServer` options are available. 
More specifically, in versions prior to 2.0.2 you only could set the recording option `dirPath`, to specify the path where you put smt2 (although the system will try to detect it automatically).


== invoking recording script in version 2.0.0 ==
Create an object named `smtRecordingOptions` with the properties that you want to customize BEFORE the above mentioned [http://code.google.com/p/smt2/wiki/readme#Including_the_record_script_on_your_page(s) 2 JavaScript lines]. Take this example page:
{{{
<html>

<head>

  <title>My document title</title>

  <script type="text/javascript">
  var smtRecordingOptions = { 
   recTime: 300,
   disabled: Math.round(Math.random()),
   warn: true, 
   warnText: "We are going to record your mouse movements for a remote usability study."
  };
  </script>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-aux.min.js"></script>  
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-record.min.js"></script>

</head>

<body>
Your page content goes here...
</body>

</html>
}}}

Here we are telling that the record script will live for 300 seconds, and users will be selected randomly -- It seems that people want to track all their visits by default, so random sampling was removed on version 2.0.0. Additionally, the system will advice users with a custom message (they must agree to get recorded their mouse activity).

Note that the last property have no ending comma.

== invoking recording script in version 2.0.1 and above ==

Now you must call the `record` method explicitly.
This is how to invoke it, based on the previous example:
{{{
<html>

<head>

  <title>My document title</title>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-aux.min.js"></script>  
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/smt2/core/js/smt-record.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
  try {
    smt2.record({
      recTime: 300,
      disabled: Math.round(Math.random()),
      warn: true, 
      warnText: "We are going to record your mouse movements for a remote usability study."
    });
  } catch(err) {}
  </script>

</head>

<body>
Your page content goes here...
</body>

</html>
}}}

In this way, now there is more flexibility in customizing your own recording intitializations.


= A note about privacy =

It is up to the webmaster enabling the `warn` property on `smt-record.js` script; however on some countries anyone who employs this type of user tracking should always inform the user about it. Furthermore, tracking of user actions should only happen for a limited amount of time. 

If you decide to warn users, a confirm dialog will prompt *before* the webpage is rendered to the browser. You can write your own code to display a fancy modal window (or DIV) instead, as [http://smt.speedzinemedia.com/smt/comments.php#comment4976 this webmaster] did on his site. This is a good visual improvement, but unfortunately displaying a customized layered dialog instead of smt2's "ugly" javascript prompt will result in non-accurate users' metrics; e.g.: browsing time will be higher, mouse activity will be lower... and so on. 

*If you are using version 2.0.0*, a better approach would be start recording the mouse activity and notify in some DIV on the page that she is being recorded -- i.e.: by not involving any awaiting prompt/dialog. In this way, if the user don't want to be considered in the tracking study, she could disable the recording script by simply clicking on a link that removes this user from database.

*If you are using version 2.0.1 and above*, you can tweak the initialization, as now the tracking script is called explicitly via JavaScript.


= Recording issues? =

Please take into account this checklist before reporting a new bug about _empty log cache_ or something similar:

 *  Server permissions. This may be the source of most of your problems. Concerning the _cache folder empty_ bug, take into account that the PHP process must have full read/write access in the `/admin/cache` dir. Setting dir permissions to 755 is enough, although you can try wider access, such as 775 or even 777.
 * No firewall is blocking connections. Just loose your firewalls rules for smt2.
 * The root user is never tracked. Try to access your site from another browser or computer.
 * If you want to make cross-domain POSTs, you must have access to the filesystem of both domains, in order to upload the required files -- see [http://code.google.com/p/smt2/wiki/readme#Important_new_feature:_cross-domain_posts note].


= Working with the gathered data =

All recorded user visits can be managed on the _tracking report_ section of the CMS. The system will use the SWF visualization tool, if Flash plugin is available. Otherwise the JavaScript visualization API will be used (which is actually deprecated).
